Using a help desk allows your support team to offer the best possible service experience to your customers.Helpdesks offer features to provide context and insight into customer experiences. They also offer features that allow you to benchmark the performance of your support team, ensuring that your team is truly efficient in assisting and delighting customers. Helpdesk tools are one of the most integral tools for successfully supporting a customer base and delivering effortless customer service.If you provide support on multiple communication channels such as email, phone, live chat, messaging channels, or social media, having a help desk will allow you to unify all support channels into one place. There is nothing more frustrating to a customer than starting in one place (such as chat or phone) and being shuffled around from one channel to the other, repeating themselves to get an answer. Having a helpdesk app allows you to give a seamless omnichannel experience to your customers by retaining context when a customer switches channels. \");\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd()()();\n        i0.ɵɵelement(37, \"app-frontend-footer\");\n      }\n    },\n    dependencies: [i2.FrontendHeaderComponent, i3.FrontendFooterComponent]\n  });\n  return HomePageComponent;\n})();","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
